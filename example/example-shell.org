* Shell Demonstration Example

  Opening up a shell window (or =eshell=) and running commands is easy:

  #+BEGIN_SRC elisp
    (demo-it-start-shell)
  #+END_SRC

  Press the ~Space~ to advance to each step which runs various commands
  at different /speeds/ specified to =demo-it-create=:

    - :insert-quickly
    - :insert-fast
    - :insert-medium
    - :insert-slow

  All demonstrations can behave the same with customization.

* Window Positions

  Depending on your monitor, you can start your shell in other
  configurations... like :below
