At the end of each sprint, each of us demonstrate accomplishments.
These reviews often incorporate the following trifecta:

  * Presentations explaining the technology and whatnot
  * Source code reviewing... correctly highlighted and interactive
  * Executing the code in a shell

During the sprint reviews, I noticed I used my org-mode-formatted
files, eshell and source code buffers... always in Emacs.
However, fat-fingering or mentally burping delayed the
gratification for my audience while I laboriously typed.
I solved this problem by predefining each "step" as an Emacs Lisp
function, and then had another function execute each function when I
hit an /advance/ key (=F12=).

After I had amassed a small army of /helper functions/, I packaged it as
=demo-it=, because I lack the imagination to come up with anything more
clever.

See the following videos as examples of what can be done:

Using this project is a four step process:

  1. Load the library in your own Elisp source code file
  2. Create zero or more helper functions that "do things", or use the
     functions provided by this project.
  3. Order the functions by calling =(demo-it-create)=
  4. Call =demo-it-start= to kick off the fun.

Press the space for each step, or call =demo-it-end= to end earlier.

For instance:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  (require 'demo-it)   ;; Load this library of functions

  (defun my-demo-step/show-code ()
    "Helper demo function that displays some source code and
  advances the presentation at one time."
    (demo-it-load-side-window "example/example.py")
    (demo-it-presentation-advance))

  ;; Order the functions and forms for this presentation:
  (demo-it-create (demo-it-presentation "example/example.org")
                   my-demo-step/show-code
                   demo-it-presentation-return ; close file and advance
                  (demo-it-run-in-eshell "python example/example.py"))

  (demo-it-start)
#+END_SRC

Each "step" given to the =demo-it-create= macro can be one of the
following:

  - an expression typically calling a helper function
  - a name of a function to call that does multiple actions
  - a string referring to a key-binding to run
  - a property that affects demonstration behavior

This package has a collection of helping functions, that can either be
called directly as part of an expression, or embedded in a
demonstration function. For a more complete example, see [[file:example/example.el][example.el]].


#+END_SRC
Each "step" is an Elisp functions that does something like load some
source code, or show off an org-mode file as a presentation.  While
this package has a collection of helping functions, the steps can use
any Elisp command to show off a feature.

For a more complete example, see [example.el][e].

I recommend installing these other Emacs packages:

  * [org-tree-slide-mode][1]
  * [org-bullets][2]
  * [expand-region][3]
  * [fancy-narrow][4]

* Control by Keywords

  The list of steps can also contain the following keywords.

  - :simple-mode :: Use SPACE to advance demo
  - :advanced-mode :: Use F12 to advance the demo
  - :insert-quickly :: Shell commands are immediately entered (default)
  - :insert-typing :: Shell commands are slowly entered
  - :fullscreen :: Start the demonstration in fullscreen mode
  - :start-one-window :: Delete other windows when started
  - :use-side-windows :: Default to open windows on the side
  - :use-lower-windows
  - :show-mode-line
  - :hide-mode-line (the default)
  - :show-org-markers :: In org-mode files show
  - :hide-org-markers (the default)
  - :variable-width
  - :fixed-width
  - :show-block-headers
  - :hide-block-headers (the default)
  - :show-fringe-mode
  - :hide-fringe-mode (the default)
  - :use-shell
  - :use-eshell
* Historical Record

  The initial release, while published on MELPA, was still rather an
  ad hoc collection of functions and poorly organized and documented.

  *Version 2* of this project attempted to remedy those shortcomings,
  cleaning and standardizing the /interface/ of functions. Also included
  is the following features:

  - Simplification of how a demonstration is constructed. Originally
    each step essentially required a helper function, but now, we can
    specify full expressions directly in the =demo-it-create=

  - Default behavior is now based on customized preferences instead of
    hard-coded values. Functions still accept optional values to
    override those defaults. Also the =demo-it-create= macro accepts
    demo-level overrides of the customized preferences.

  - Now using the [[https://github.com/10sr/github-elpa][github-elpa project]] to make better releases.

  *Version 3* is a plan to have each step more repeatable. Currently,
  each step assumes a state built by the previous steps, which makes
  developing, debugging, and reversing difficult.
